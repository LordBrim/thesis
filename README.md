**Step 3**: Open your clone in your compiler. 

**Step 4**: Run the command ```npx expo install``` to initialize your clone.

**Step 5**: You can run the project on your device or install android studio with expo go https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/. 

**Step 6**: Create your own branch off the branch you selected. This way you can make commits without interfering with other branches. You can find tasks for development [here in projects](https://github.com/users/Andrei-Sager/projects/5/views/1).


**Step 7**: Make a pull request to merge your brach changes.

Ps: Mag pull request na lng kayo sasabihin ko na lng kung may problema.
